# Linnworks.net SDK
Linnworks.net SDK is lightweight reflection of the Linnworks.net API project. The following repository allows you to connect to the Linnworks.net API in your required language.

Please see http://apps.linnworks.net/ for more information and guidelines on using the API.

##.net Wrapper
We provide a .net wrapper to allow for a object-based communication with the Linnworks.net API.

##Javascript Wrapper
The Javascript wrapper is a light-weight wrapper for the Linnworks.net API. As this uses the main thread, it is best to look into using each call within a promise. This has been left out to allow for you to make the decision yourself.

# LinnAppFramework
LinnAppFramework is a concept created to show the usage of the LinnworksNetSDK. You can use this for external pages, or use it for a standalone web-app.
